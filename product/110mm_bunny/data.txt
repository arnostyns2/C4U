The 3D Printed Easter Bunny (110 mm) is a modern, minimalist Easter decoration designed with clean lines and a sculptural ribbed surface texture.
The bunny consists of two rounded stacked spheres forming the body and head, finished with two upright elongated ears. The vertical ribbed pattern wraps around the entire form, creating a soft light-and-shadow effect that changes depending on the angle and lighting.
The base of the bunny features a contrasting neon color accent, adding a playful and fresh spring touch to the otherwise neutral body tone.
